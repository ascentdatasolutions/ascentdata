      <description>As reference #1 letâ€™s use a traditional BI-oriented data stack which looks approximately like this:
Google Big Query or any other DWH if we take a different organization is in the middle of the stack. There are multiple data sources and ETL or ELT software that collects data from these data sources and puts it into the DWH. Afterward, as soon as data are in the data warehouse, Looker is connected to it for business intelligence and since it is a part of Google Cloud it integrates perfectly with Google Big Query.</description>
