      <description>Ascent Data Solutions helps your data act. Data changes frequently. We enable your data and ops teams to configure data expectations and automate actions based on the status of it.
We analyse three examples of modern data stacks. One is more traditional and business intelligence oriented. Another one is poor and typical for start-ups at the beginning of their lifecycle. And the third one is more advanced and is deeply integrated with organizational processes and decision making.</description>
