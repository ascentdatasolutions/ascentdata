[Ascent Data Solutions](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) helps your data act.
Data changes frequently. We enable your data and ops teams to configure data expectations and automate actions based on the status of it.

> We analyse three examples of modern data stacks. One is more traditional and business intelligence oriented. Another one is poor and typical for start-ups at the beginning of their lifecycle. And the third one is more advanced and is deeply integrated with organizational processes and decision making.
